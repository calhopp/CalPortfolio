	<h2>
		I am currently a junior in the Magazine School District.
	</h2>
	<h2>
		I am working on improving my web development skills, and figured why not supplement expenses while I'm working on it?
	</h2>
	<h2>
		Anyways, I'm here to learn and improve the community while doing it.
	</h2>
	<h2> 
		Here are a few examples of what I've done.
