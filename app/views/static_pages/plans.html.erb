		My plans?
	</h2>
	<h2>
		Well, after I graduate high school, I'm probably going to college. Not sure where quite yet, but I'm probably going to major in comp sci.
	</h2>
	<h2>
		I'll probably keep using this to fund college and life expenses. Might open up to some higher-level development once I can legally sign contracts.
